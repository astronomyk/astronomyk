Farming Seaweed as a means of reducing livestock methane emissions
==================================================================

Cows burp and fart methane:

- https://phys.org/news/2019-07-potential-methane-cows.html
- Between 70 - 120 kg/year
- 37% of human CH4 emissions
- 1.5E9 cows globally

Methane is a green house gas more potent than CO2

- https://climatechangeconnection.org/emissions/co2-equivalents/#
- 1 tonne CH4 is equivalent to 25 tonnes of CO2 (GWP ~ 25)
- (fyi N2O is ~300x CO2)

Methane reduction can earn CO2 credits for sale on carbon markets

- https://ember-climate.org/carbon-price-viewer/
- 1 tCO2e is ~20€ in europe
- Hence 1 tCH4 is ~500€

Seaweed add to feed can eliminate methane production in the cow's gut

- https://research.csiro.au/futurefeed/
- 100kg CH4 per cow per year ~ 2.5 tCO2e ~ 50€ per cow per year
- 2% by dry weight of seaweed is sufficient
- https://www.drovers.com/article/how-much-hay-will-cow-consume-0
- Cows eat ~15kg per day in feed dry mass
- 0.3kg seaweed needed per day per cow, or ~100kg per year per cow

Cost of seaweed additive must be less than income from CO2 certificates

- Expense: 100kg seaweed per cow per year
- Income: 50€ per cow per year from CO2 certificates
- Maximum cost of seaweed: 500€ per tonne - of 0.5€ per kg

Cost of seaweed production varies wildly

- https://www.intrafish.com/aquaculture/seaweed-prices-in-the-philippines-hike-on-high-demand/2-1-216509
- Cheapest seaweed is in S.E. Asia
- (?) The Philipines produced seaweed at 100€ per tonne
- 400€ / tonne for dried Gracilaria from Vietnam (alibaba.com)
~ 1000€ / tonne for Seaweed powder from Vietnam

Conclusion

- Currently just economically unfeasible
- 10% of cows globablly eating seaweed - 3.7% of global CH4 emission eliminated
- 10% of cows eating seaweed, means 15 million tonnes needed
- 10% margin on sale price - 50€ * 15 million = 750 M€ annually
- 10% of all cows = All cows in USA (6%), Australia (2%), France (1.3%), and Germany (0.8%)
- (33% of all cow are in Brazil (14%), India (12%), China (7%))

Misc

- http://www.bim.ie/media/bim/content/downloads/Lucy,Watson.pdf
- Cost of feed for a cow is >500€ per year
- Seaweed reduced feed requirements by ~10%, meaning savings of 50€ per year per cow
- 50€ savings + 50€ for CO2 certificate, means 100€ per cow per year
- Cost of seaweed could be up to 1000€ per tonne for this to still be economically viable

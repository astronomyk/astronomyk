# Using spectrophotometric techniques to determine soil carbon abundances 

## Main ideas

1. [nori.com](nori.com) trades carbon removal certificates for money
2. Farmers can earn money by changing farming practices to sequester carbon dioxide in the soil
3. Farmers need a method to verify how much carbon has been sequestered
4. Soil carbon measurements need to be done in-situ in close to real-time
5. Current soil carbon determination methods include looking at soil colour, or mass spectroscopy in a lab
6. Why not use spectrophotometry with a series of LED lamps and a photodetector?

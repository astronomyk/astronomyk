Background
----------
Agriculture is a currently a net emitter of CO2. Additionally
industrial agriculture techniques are respionsible for the
degredation of soil quiality and errosion of valuable top soil. In
contrast, regenerative agriculture techniques such as no-till (or low-till),
and cover-crops have shown that this paradigm can be reversed by
sequestering CO2 in the soil.

It has been shown that produce yields from farms using regenerative techniques
are equal to, or even greater than the yield from conventionally managed
farms. However the transition to a regenerative farming technique causes
farmers to shoulder the cost of lower yields during the transition period, even
when such practices are leading to increased soil carbon levels during the
transition periods. This decreased income over a period of 5-7 years (on
average) has proved enough of a hurdle that most farmers choose to continue
using conventional farming methods.

THe carbon budget of the biosphere is limited. This is becoming more and more
obvious and the global business community is waking up to the fact that this
issue needs to be addressed.

In response several companies (e.g. nori.com) have appeared with the goal of
facilitating, or indeed proving directly, the market based solutions needed
to address the problem of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Nori
provides an online blockchain based market place that connects nett C02
poducers (e.g. coal power plants) with nett C02 sequesterers (e.g.
regenerative farmers). At its core, this market mechanism allows those who emit
CO2 into the atmosphere to pay others to sequester an equivalent amount of
CO2 into the ground. Farmers who are using regenerative agricultural
practices can therefore be paid for continually sequestering CO2 into their
soils. Farmers will essentially be paid for "farming carbon". Other farmers
who still use conventional farming practices (i.e. CO2 positive) could
therefore offset the drop in yields during the transition to regenerative
methods with the profits made from their carbon farming efforts.

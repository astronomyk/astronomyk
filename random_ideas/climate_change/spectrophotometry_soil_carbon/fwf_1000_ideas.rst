Background
----------
Agriculture is a currently a net emitter of CO2. Additionally
industrial agriculture techniques are respionsible for the
degredation of soil quiality and errosion of valuable top soil. In
contrast, regenerative agriculture techniques such as no-till (or low-till),
and cover-crops have shown that this paradigm can be reversed by
sequestering CO2 in the soil.

It has been shown that produce yields from farms using regenerative techniques
are equal to, or even greater than the yield from conventionally managed
farms. However the transition to a regenerative farming technique causes
farmers to shoulder the cost of lower yields during the transition period, even
when such practices are leading to increased soil carbon levels during the
transition periods. This decreased income over a period of 5-7 years (on
average) has proved enough of a hurdle that most farmers choose to continue
using conventional farming methods.

THe carbon budget of the biosphere is limited. This is becoming more and more
obvious and the global business community is waking up to the fact that this
issue needs to be addressed.

In response several companies (e.g. nori.com) have appeared with the goal of
facilitating, or indeed proving directly, the market based solutions needed
to address the problem of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Nori
provides an online blockchain based market place that connects nett C02
poducers (e.g. coal power plants) with nett C02 sequesterers (e.g.
regenerative farmers). At its core, this market mechanism allows those who emit
CO2 into the atmosphere to pay others to sequester an equivalent amount of
CO2 into the ground. Farmers who are using regenerative agricultural
practices can therefore be paid for continually sequestering CO2 into their
soils. Farmers will essentially be paid for "farming carbon". Conventional
farmers (i.e. CO2 positive) could therefore offset the drop in yields during
the transition to regenerative methods with the profits made from their
carbon farming efforts.

Validation is the main hurdle faced by the marketplace such as Nori. How can
Nori confirm that x tonnes fo CO2 has been sequestered in the soil by a
farmer practicing regenerative agricultural techniques. Several techniques
exist to measure the percentage of soil organic carbon (SOC).  Most
standard methods require samples to be transported to a laboratory for
testing, making large scale determinations of SOC inefficient and expensive.
The lack of cheap, in-situ SOC measument methodss is the primary hurdle for
the market places like Nori. Without reliable SOC measurments, it will be
impossible for carbon offset buyers to trust the data provided by carbon
farmers




Recently several authors have shown that a near infrared
spectroscopy can be used to accurately and reliably determine the level or soil
organic carbon. Near infrared spectroscopy currently requires soil samples
to be transported to a laboratory for analysis.

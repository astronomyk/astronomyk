Vertical integration of a micro carbon offsets business model
=============================================================
Bringing CO2 offsets to the general public in an easily accessible manner
Small purchases go unnoticed. large monthly lump sums are scary.
Immediately offset items are throw-aways conscience cleaners.


What is needed:

- Producers
- Markets / Traders
- Consumers


Micro-Carbon-Offsets
--------------------
(0.02€ / kgCO2e)

Micro carbon offsets (UCOs) are everyday impulse buys, like a snickers bar or a cup of coffee. 
E.g. 
- A tank of petrol ~50kg --> petrol @ 3kgCO2 / kg --> 150kgCO2 --> €3
- 250g Beef Steak --> beef @ >25kgCO2 / kg --> 6.25kgCO2 --> €0.13
- Flight VIE-Rome-VIE --> 200kgCO2 --> 4€
- A Big Mac --> €0.10

Consumers
---------
Voluntary markets direct to consumers
- Petrol stations
- Restaurants (steak, etc)

Through App, enter amount consumed. Immediately booked to credit card, etc.
Transaction is saved in database/blockchain.
CO2 certificates are issued when the collective total reaches a tonne

Add payment option to Billa kassa, McDonalds kassa
--> Encourages companies to track their supply chain CO2 output.

Competition
- ReduceApp -> Connects to your bank account and reminds you of possible CO2 sinks in your spending. Big brother approach. Not so friendly.


Certificates
------------
NORI tokens are worth 1 tonne/CO2e.
Nori verifies the CO2 sequestration. Removes that work for us.

Ocean CO2 sinks 
Project Vesta
Kelp forests

--or--

Produce own certificates


Producers
---------
Regenerative argriculture techniques
Soil probes to measure in real time fluctuations of soil properties:
SOC, NPK, pH, CEC, H2O

Why will farmers care? Money.
Real time monitoring of soil properties enable precision fertilisation, watering
-> Less tractor km, less NPK, less water usage, less pumping --> more money
-> SOC translates to CO2 certificates --> money

Why will we care?
Preferential access to CO2 certs at fixed prices
Supply-Demand balance. 
Remove 3rd party supplier (Nori)

Bonus
- Miniturised spectrographs that can be used for other applications
--> Composition/impurity measurements in industrial practices
--> Water/air quality measurements
--> Food nutrient content

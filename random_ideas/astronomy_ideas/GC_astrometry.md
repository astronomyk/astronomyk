# The IMF of YMCs in the GC using the ELT and astrometry

![](https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2013/theoriginoft.jpg)

## Goals: 
1. To determine the lowest mass stars that will be observable in young clusters
   in the galactic center for a given star density.
2. To determine what percentage of cluster memberships based on proper motions 
   are true or false positives and what percentage are false negatives.  
   (i.e. how many should belong to the cluster but don't, and how many don't
   belong to the cluster, but are included)
3. To combine these two results to determine the lowest reliable-observable mass
   for a star is that definitely has cluster membership. Hence where will the
   reliability limit be for IMF studies in the galactic centre
 
## Background
* IMF: Initial Mass Function
  
  How many stars are formed of which mass during a star formation event. 
  Important for all aspects of astronomy, from aliens to cosmology 
  
  Literature: 
  [Kroupa 2001](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0102155), 
  [Chabrier 2003](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0304382)
   
* YMC: Young Massive Clusters

  Tighty grouped clusters of stars, generally containing >10000 members. 
  Young means all original members are still around, i.e. non have gone supernova.
  Massive means the IMF will be well sampled in all mass regimes, i.e. M>10Msun and M<0.1Msun
  These facts combine to give us a good picture of the end product of a star formation event
  
  Examples: Westerlund 1, R136, Arches cluster, Quintuplet cluster, Trumpler 14

* GC: Galactic Centre

  Current knowledge of the IMF is restricted to the solar neighbourhood where
  the environment (metalicity) is more or less constant. 
  The galactic centre has a very different environment
  - Higher gravitational potential
  - Lower metalicity
  - Higher external radiation field
  - Higher density of stars
  Perfect for studying the effect of the environment on the IMF

* ELT: The Extremely Large Telescope

  The first next generation 40m class telescope.
  It will have the resolution and sensitivity needed to study the motions of 
  individual stars in the galactic centre.

* Astrometry: Detectable movements of stars over time

  The motion of stars over time. This allows us to calculate trajectories and 
  hence differentiate the members of bound groups from the background and 
  foreground stars.
  The line-of-sight volume towrads the galactic centre is very densely populated.
